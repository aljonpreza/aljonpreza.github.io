about: "Fueled by curiosity, I delved into the world of digital art. I was inspired to share this newfound passion with my friends, so I created digital portraits for them that were later printed. Witnessing their joy as they unwrapped their personalized portraits was an incredible reward, affirming art as a means of heartfelt expression and connection."
